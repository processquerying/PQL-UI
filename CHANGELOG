PQL ver 1.3
====================
1) Test code has been moved from src/ to /test so that Maven's "test" target works
2) References to MySQL tables and function are no longer hardcoded to use a database named "pql"
3) Configuring a MySQL JDBC URL that includes a query part now works
4) Extension to the PQL grammar for handling binary predicate macros (added keyword “SOME”)
5) Binary predicate constructions are now interpreted correctly according to the dynamic semantics of PQL
6) Updated the PQL tool and PQL bot CLI messages
7) Folder heirarchy has been added to database ('pql_folder_id', 'pql_folder_name', 'pql_folder_struct')
8) Added new command line functions: 'mkdir', 'rmdir', 'ls' and 'mv'
9) Updated query, store, delete and reset functionality

PQL ver 1.2
====================
1)  Optimized execution of unary predicate macros and binary predicate macro 'CanCooccur' (handling sets of tasks instead of each individual task)
2)  Improved handling of indexing timeouts in PQL bots (improved termination of Java threads)
3)  Minor fix in parsing of binary predicate macros 

PQL ver 1.1.2
====================
1)  Changed PQL syntax from '*' to 'GetTasks()' to denote the set of all tasks of a model matched to the query

PQL ver 1.1.1
====================
1)  Introduced support of two PQL query attributes: Universe ('*') and AttributeName (STRING)
2)  Introduced support of two PQL query locations: Universe ('*') and LocationPath (STRING)
3)  Introduced org.pql.test.core package with two JUnit tests that every next PQL commit must pass
4)  Changed to ensure that for every PQL query, attributes and locations get interpreted only once
